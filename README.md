# Application Templates
This project contains OpenShift v3 application templates which support
applications based on Red Hat Fuse Integration Services.

## Article on how to get started with this OpenShift template
See http://www.opensourcerers.org/first-fuse-application-on-openshift-v3-1/

## Common Image Repositories
The `fis-image-streams.json` file contains __ImageStream__ definitions for all
Fuse Integration Services.  This will need to be
installed in the common `openshift` namespace (`oc create -f fis-images-streams.json -n openshift`) before using any of the templates generated by Fuse Integration Services archetypes.

## Example
The easiest way to use the templates is to install them in your project,
then use the _Create+_ button in the OpenShift console to create your application.
The console will prompt you for the values for all of the parameters used by the template.
To set this up for a particular template from a project generated using Fuse Integration Services archetype:
```
$ oc create -n openshift -f fis-image-streams.json
$ oc create -n myproject -f quickstart-template.json
```
After executing the above, you should be able to see the template after pressing _Create+_ in your project.

Or, if you prefer the command line:
```
$ oc create -n openshift -f fis-image-streams.json
$ oc process -n yourproject -f quickstart-template.json -v <template parameters> | oc create -n yourproject -f -
```

You may also install the templates into the `openshift` namespace in order to make them
available to all users:
```
$ oc create -n openshift -f quickstart-template.json
```

## Fuse Console
The Red Hat Fuse console eases the discovery and management of Fuse applications deployed on OpenShift.

You can run the following instructions to deploy the Fuse console on your OpenShift cluster.
There exist two OpenShift templates to choose from, depending on the following characteristics:

| Template | Descripton |
| -------- | ---------- |
| [fis-console-cluster-template.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-fuse/application-templates/master/fis-console-cluster-template.json) | Use an OAuth client that requires the `cluster-admin` role to be created. The Fuse console can discover and connect to Fuse applications deployed across multiple namespaces / projects. |
| [fis-console-namespace-template.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-fuse/application-templates/master/fis-console-namespace-template.json) | Use a service account as OAuth client, which only requires `admin` role in a project to be created. This restricts the Fuse console access to this single project, and as such acts as a single tenant deployment. |

To install the Fuse console template, execute the following command:

```sh
$ oc create -n myproject -f fis-console-namespace-template.json
```

Then, you should be able to see the template after navigating to _Add to Project > Select from Project_ in your project.

Or, if you prefer the command line:

```sh
$ oc new-app -n myproject -f fis-console-namespace-template.json \
  -p ROUTE_HOSTNAME=<HOST>
```

Note that the `ROUTE_HOSTNAME` parameter can be omitted when using the `fis-console-namespace-template` template.
In that case, OpenShift automatically generates one for you.

You can obtain more information about the template parameters, by executing the following command:

```
$ oc process --parameters -f fis-console-namespace-template.json
NAME                     DESCRIPTION                                                                    VALUE
APP_NAME                 The name assigned to the application.                                          fuse70-console
APP_VERSION              The application version.                                                       1.0
IMAGE_STREAM_NAMESPACE   Namespace in which the Fuse ImageStreams are installed. These ImageStreams
                         are normally installed in the openshift namespace. You should only need to
                         modify this if you've installed the ImageStreams in a different
                         namespace/project.                                                             openshift
ROUTE_HOSTNAME           The externally-reachable host name that routes to the Red Hat Fuse console
                         service
CPU_REQUEST              The amount of CPU to request.                                                  0.2
MEMORY_REQUEST           The amount of memory required for the container to run.                        32Mi
CPU_LIMIT                The amount of CPU the container is limited to use.                             1.0
MEMORY_LIMIT             The amount of memory the container is limited to use.                          32Mi
```

You can obtain the status of your deployment, by running:

```sh
$ oc status
In project myproject on server https://192.168.64.12:8443

https://fuse-console.192.168.64.12.nip.io (redirects) (svc/fuse70-console-service)
